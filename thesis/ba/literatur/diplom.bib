 abstract = {A method is developed for constructing a confidence band for a cumulative distribution function with known functional form. The band is derived using the maximum absolute difference between the true function and an estimator of it. The normal distribution with unknown mean and variance is treated in detail. The band derived in this case is found to be superior in certain instances to the one due to Kanofsky (1968a) with respect to the expected band width at selected points, and the expected maximum band width.},

 abstract = {We describe a method for constructing likelihood-based confidence regions for a vector parameter, using the bootstrap and nonparametric density estimation. The technique is illustrated by application to a numerical example, and its theoretical properties are elucidated. It is argued that likelihood-based regions should not be approximated by ellipses, if we are to have any hope of capturing first-order departures from normality. Bootstrap algorithms for constructing simultaneous confidence intervals for the components of a vector parameter are also presented. Advantages of the percentile-t method over the ordinary percentile method are demonstrated in a multivariate setting.},

 abstract = {Several nonparametric goodness-of-fit tests are based on the empirical distribution function. In the presence of nuisance parameters, the tests are generally constructed by first estimating these nuisance parameters. In such a case, it is well known that critical values shift, and the asymptotic null distribution of the test statistic may depend in a complex way on the unknown parameters. In this paper we use bootstrap methods to estimate the null distribution. We shall consider both parametric and nonparametric bootstrap methods. We shall first demonstrate that, under very general conditions, the process obtained by subtracting the population distribution function with estimated parameters from the empirical distribution has the same weak limit as the corresponding bootstrap version. Of course in the nonparametric bootstrap case a bias correction is needed. This result is used to show that the bootstrap method consistently estimates the null distributions of various goodness-of-fit tests. These results hold not only in the univariate case but also in the multivariate setting.},

 abstract = {We discuss the following problem: given a random sample X = (X1, X2, ⋯, Xn) from an unknown probability distribution F, estimate the sampling distribution of some prespecified random variable R(X, F), on the basis of the observed data x. (Standard jackknife theory gives an approximate mean and variance in the case R(X, F) = θ(F̂) - θ(F), θ some parameter of interest.) A general method, called the "bootstrap," is introduced, and shown to work satisfactorily on a variety of estimation problems. The jackknife is shown to be a linear approximation method for the bootstrap. The exposition proceeds by a series of examples: variance of the sample median, error rates in a linear discriminant analysis, ratio estimation, estimating regression parameters, etc.},

 abstract = {This is a review of bootstrap methods, concentrating on basic ideas and applications rather than theoretical considerations. It begins with an exposition of the bootstrap estimate of standard error for one-sample situations. Several examples, some involving quite complicated statistical procedures, are given. The bootstrap is then extended to other measures of statistical accuracy such as bias and prediction error, and to complicated data structures such as time series, censored data, and regression models. Several more examples are presented illustrating these ideas. The last third of the paper deals mainly with bootstrap confidence intervals.},
